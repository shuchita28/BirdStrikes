# ðŸ¦… Bird Strikes Analysis ðŸ¦…
## CS5200 Database Management Systems : Practicum 1
## Project by: Shuchita Mishra & Soham Shinde

Analyzing bird strikes on aircrafts based on data fetched from FAA

In this practicum we built a database that can be used to analyze bird strikes on aircraft. 

For an existing data set from the FAA [1], we: 
- built a logical data model, a relational schema, 
- realized the relational schema in MySQL, 
- loaded data into the database, 
- executed analytical SQL queries, 
- and finally performed some simple visualization of the data
